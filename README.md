## Overview

**Feeding Malaysia: Local Crops and Food Imports** is an interactive data visualisation dashboard designed to explore Malaysia‚Äôs agricultural production and food import dependency trends.  
It provides insights into the nation‚Äôs local crop productivity, import reliance, and agricultural diversification across states and years.

The project combines multiple real-world datasets to present a clear narrative on Malaysia‚Äôs food security and self-sustainability between **2000‚Äì2022**.

## Objectives

- Visualise total crop production across Malaysian states.
- Compare annual crop yields and planted areas to identify efficiency.
- Track Malaysia‚Äôs dependence on food imports over time.
- Analyse crop distribution and share of total production by category.
- Present agricultural and economic patterns clearly and interactively.

## Visualisations Included

### Total Crop Production by State (2017‚Äì2022)
A choropleth map showing total crop production across Malaysia‚Äôs 13 states and 3 federal territories.  
The map highlights high-output regions such as Johor and Sarawak.

### Malaysia‚Äôs Food Import Dependency (2000‚Äì2021)
A line chart displaying Malaysia‚Äôs growing reliance on imported food items across two decades.

### Crop Composition by State (2022)
A stacked bar chart illustrating each state‚Äôs crop composition (paddy, fruits, vegetables, industrial crops, etc.) in 2022.

### Crop Efficiency: Planted Area vs Production
A scatter plot comparing each crop‚Äôs planted area against production output to reveal efficiency levels.

### Production Trends for Major Crops (2017‚Äì2022)
A multi-line chart visualising yearly production changes for major crops like paddy, fruits, and vegetables.

### Crop Share of Total Production (2022)
A horizontal bar chart ranking crop types by their percentage contribution to Malaysia‚Äôs total agricultural output.

### Malaysia‚Äôs Total Crop Production Over Time (2017‚Äì2022)
An area chart showing the nation‚Äôs total crop production growth trend and fluctuations.
